                The Copa América is the oldest football competition of national
                teams in the world. It was disputed for the first time in a
                trial edition in 1910, but it had its first official edition
                between July 2 and 17, 1916, as part of the commemorations of
                the centennial of Argentina's independence. In addition to the
                host country, Chile, Uruguay and Brazil also participated.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since 1993, the tournament has generally featured 12 teams—all
                10 CONMEBOL teams and two additional teams from other
                confederations. Mexico participated in every tournament between
                1993 and 2016, with one additional team drawn from CONCACAF,
                except for 1999, when AFC team Japan filled out the 12-team
                roster, and 2019, which featured Japan and Qatar.
